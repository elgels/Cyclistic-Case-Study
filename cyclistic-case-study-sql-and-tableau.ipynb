ASK\n","\n","\n","<a id=\"2\"></a>\n","### A. ABOUT THE COMPANY\n","\n","\n","In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n","\n","Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as Casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic Members.\n","\n","Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual Members are much more profitable than Casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the director of marketing (Lily Moreno) believes that maximizing the number of annual Members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert Casual riders into Members. She notes that Casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting Casual riders into annual Members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual Members and Casual riders differ, why Casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. \n","\n","<a id=\"3\"></a>\n","### B. CHARACTERS AND TEAMS\n","\n","* Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike.\n","* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing, Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n","* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.\n","* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n","\n","<a id=\"4\"></a>\n","### C. BUSINESS TASK\n","\n","Working as a data analyst in the marketing analytics team, I will analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to gain insight into how Casual riders and annual Members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the marketing team will design a new strategy to convert Casual riders into annual Members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and visualizations.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f7e7e286","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.015736,"end_time":"2023-08-10T19:14:21.805088","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-10T19:14:21.789352","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<a id=\"5\"></a>\n","# 2.

The distance for Casuals is the distance between starting and ending points without considering for example, the extra miles they took when going around town."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"id":"f827f95a","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.26966Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.269166Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.279637Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.278259Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"papermill":{"duration":0.038094,"end_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.282096","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.244002","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1680125504300' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;CyclisticCaseStudyViz1&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CyclisticCaseStudyViz1&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;CyclisticCaseStudyViz1&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div> <script type='text/javascript'> var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1680125504300'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1377px';} var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); </script>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["%%HTML\n","<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1680125504300' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;CyclisticCaseStudyViz1&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CyclisticCaseStudyViz1&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;CyclisticCaseStudyViz1&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div> <script type='text/javascript'> var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1680125504300'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1377px';} var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); </script>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2860931c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.022755,"end_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.327942","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.305187","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Casual rides showed a preference for electric bikes: 58.6% of all rides used electric bikes while 41.4% used classic bikes.

Although Casual rides in the early morning of the day (1am to 4am) seem a little high, we can observe that Casuals prefer late morning and afternoon rides at an average of about 29 minutes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"id":"7152caa2","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.716091Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.714948Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.726004Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.724425Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.048256,"end_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.729113","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.680857","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1680186843215' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;Cyclistic_16795966693180&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Cyclistic_16795966693180&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;Cyclistic_16795966693180&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div> <script type='text/javascript'> var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1680186843215'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';} var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); </script>\n"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["%%HTML\n","<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1680186843215' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;Cyclistic_16795966693180&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Cyclistic_16795966693180&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Cy&#47;Cyclistic_16795966693180&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div> <script type='text/javascript'> var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1680186843215'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='800px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';} var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement); </script>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7c5403db","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024054,"end_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.777402","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-08-10T19:16:22.753348","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["The top 200 routes for rides, were taken as unique combinations of start and end stations grouped by the number of times that route was ridden during the year.

ACT\n","\n","\n","<a id=\"13\"></a>\n","### A. CONCLUSIONS\n","\n","* We concluded that Members are mostly commuters while Casual riders are tourists and visitors that use bikes to get to local attractions and events.\n","\n","* 59.3% of total rides were Member trips, 40.6% were Casual rides.\n","\n","* The average ride length in minutes was 12.58 for Members and 25.54 for Casuals. This seems to indicate that Members usually ride bikes to commute while Casuals ride mostly for tourism and leisure, taking more time per ride.\n","\n","* Casual rides showed a preference for electric bikes, probably because these are faster and more reliable for longer trips. The Casual average ride length for electric bikes was much lower than that for classic bikes (16 vs. 28.6 minutes). \n","\n","* Members on the other hand used both electric and classic bikes at the same rate, and at a consistent average length per ride (11 to 13 minutes). \n","\n","* For Casuals, the number of rides peak during the summer months of June, July and August. Casual rides seem to be closely related to the weather; during the colder months of winter (December, January and February) Casual rides declined sharply.\n","\n","* Members number of rides and average length per ride (10 to 14 minutes) tend to be more consistent throughout the months of the year.\n","\n","* Casual rides peak on Saturdays and Sundays. For Members the opposite happens, Saturday and Sunday are the days with the lowest number of rides. \n","\n","* During the weekend Casuals take longer trips at 28 to 29 minutes per ride. Member rides are more consistent at 12 to 14 minutes for all days of the week.\n","\n","* Members follow a working schedule with most trips happening during the commuting time of 4pm to 6pm. Casuals prefer the afternoons with most trips happening between 12pm and 7pm.\n","\n","* For the average time per ride, Member rides are more consistent with 10 to 13 minutes throughout the hours of the day.  For Casuals, the average length per ride tends to be longer, almost twice as much as Member rides.  \n","\n","* Casual routes are concentrated in the downtown area of Chicago, showing that most Casual rides are taken by tourists and visitors looking to get around downtown to visit local attractions.\n","\n","* On the other hand, Member trips were more of the commuter type. Rides were taken across a wider section of the map, reaching farther areas from the center of the city. \n","\n","<a id=\"14\"></a>\n","### B. RECOMMENDATIONS\n","\n","We concluded that Members and Casual riders are two different customer segments that have different needs. Converting some Casual riders into Members might be possible if there is a group of Casual riders that use the bikes to commute but don’t want to commit to an annual membership. It would be recommendable to have a marketing strategy that communicates to these Casual riders that they can save money with a membership. The next step though would be to have a customer survey to find out how often this is happening.\n","\n","However, the group from Casual riders that acquire a membership will probably not be a massive move. We could estimate how big this group is by the results of the customer survey and then analyze financial information such as cost and profits. This way we could better measure the financial impact of converting some Casual riders to annual Members. \n","\n","We believe that keeping pricing flexibility is very important. Communicating the benefits of each pricing plan is critical as well. Casual riders can be engaged by digital marketing through social media. Also, campaigns such as Google Display would be useful to advertise in thousands of websites with touristic content.
